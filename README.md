Intractive ASH - an intractive oracle performance tunning tool
This is a self-created Application to troubleshoot oracle performance. 

It is designed in a way that, even a novice Database administrator could use this tool to attend a critical performance issue. 

The primary objective here is to increase the DBAâ€™s/Developers productivity and effectiveness by providing visual cue/facts about oracle system performance. 

It further allows them to filter, zoom and drill deep into the metrics to identify the Bottleneck just by few mouse clicks.

 And when the DBA really know the bottleneck, the resulting analysis and recommendations to solve the problem are much, much simpler
